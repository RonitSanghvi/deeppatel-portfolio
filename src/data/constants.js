    desc: `My time in the Personal Support Worker (PSW) program at Centennial College has been an incredible learning experience that has helped me grow both professionally and personally. Over the past two semesters, I have studied a wide range of subjects that have given me the skills and confidence to provide quality care to clients in a variety of healthcare settings.

In SEMESTER-1, I completed the following courses:
    
    PSHS 100 – Anatomy: I learned the structure and function of the human body systems and how they relate to client care.
    
    
    PSHS 101 – Foundations of Personal Support Worker: I developed a strong understanding of the PSW role and responsibilities.
    
    
    PSHS 102 – Personal Support Communications: This course helped me build effective communication skills with clients, families, and healthcare teams.
    
    
    PSHS 103 – Developmental Changes & Alteration in Health: I learned how aging and illness affect clients physically and emotionally.
    
    
    PSHS 104 – Foundations of Mental Health: I learned how to support clients with mental health conditions with empathy and respect.
    
    
In SEMESTER-2, I studied:
    
    PSHS 122 – Supporting Clients in Palliative Care: I gained skills to provide compassionate end-of-life care and support grieving families.
    
    
    PSHS 123 – Personal & Professional Growth: This course encouraged me to reflect on my skills, values, and development as a future PSW.
    
    
    PSHS 125 – Clinical Practice: I applied classroom knowledge in real-life settings like Sienna Midland Gardens, building hands-on experience with clients.
    
    
    PSHS 126 – Community Placement: I learned how to deliver care in the community and adapt to different client needs outside of long-term care.
    
    
Each course played a key role in preparing me for real-life PSW responsibilities. I improved in areas like infection control, mobility support, communication, and patient-centered care. My instructors, clinical supervisor, and care partners supported my development and provided valuable feedback during my placements.
    
I am proud of how far I’ve come — especially in building strong relationships with clients and working as part of a healthcare team. I now feel confident and ready to begin my career as a Personal Support Worker. In the future, I plan to gain work experience, complete more certifications like GPA and dementia care, and possibly return to school to become a nurse or social worker.
    
This journey has shaped me into a compassionate, confident, and capable caregiver — ready to make a difference.
